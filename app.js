// First i need to create a variable for my 4 cards, they will be suits. "Diamond " "Heart" "Spade" "Club"
// I then need and array for all my cards/suits (my data structure)
// its like putting all 4 cards in a box. a box that will not change but the cards inside will
// I need to display all of the cards on the screen for the player
// I need to shuffle the array of cards
// I will use the Fisher-Yates shuffle algorithm to shuffle the cards
// i will then ask the player to reveal one of the 4 suits
// the option will always be the same 4 suits
// I will then check if the players guess is correct
// if the player is correct, they win
// if the player is incorrect, they lose
// I will then display the result of the game
// I will then ask the player if they want to play again
// If the player wants to play again, I will reset the game
// If the player does not want to play again, I will end the game
//
