// First i need to create a variable for my 4 cards, they will be suits. "Diamond " "Heart" "Spade" "Club"

// I will then need to create a variable for the selected suit

// I will then need to create a variable for the current cards

// I will then need to create a variable for the player's guess

//  I will then need to create a function to start the game

// I will use the Fisher-Yates shuffle algorithm to shuffle the cards

// I will then need to create a function to check the player's guess

// I will need to check if the player's guess is correct or incorrect

// I will need to display a message to the player based on their guess

// If the player's guess is correct, I will display a message saying "You got lucky!"

// If the player's guess is incorrect, I will display a message saying "Haha! Wrong!!"

// I will then need to create a function to show the replay options

// If the player wants to play again, I will reset the game

// I need to create a function to reset the game
