Project Description 

My game is "Guess the Card"
This game will consist of 1 player against a computer. 
The player will always be the the one interacting as the guesser 
The computer will be the dealer who reveals 4 suited cards, the dealer will shuffle the cards and ask the player to find the position of a suit. 




USER STORIES 
Main Goal
As a player, the first thing I would like to see a set of instructions explaining the rules
As a player, I need all of the suits displayed properly in front of me (Diamonds, Clubs, Hearts, Spade)
As a player, I would then want a start game button that I can click
As a player, I want to see the cards shuffled faced down in front of me after clicking start game
As a player, I need the random shuffle funtion to work properly so I only have a 25% chance of selecting the right card each turn. 
As a player, I need to see the 4 cards displayed face down in front of me
As a player, I need the dealer to ask me  which suit at random to find within the 4 faced down cards
As a player, I need to be able to select any of the 4 face down cards
As a player, I would like a "submit answer" button that recognizes my selected choice
As a player, I need the faced down card I selected to reveal its suit 
As a player, I need my game to recoginze if my guess was correct and if it was wrong
As a player, I would like the game to recoginze when it is over and offer me to try again or reset
As a player, I want to be told good job or try again after my selection





Stretch Goal
As a player, I want to see a cool shuffle animation 
As a player, I would want to see a scoredboard and a time clock 
As a player, I would like to increase the difficulty by adding numbers in addition the suits. 
As a player, I would like to start with "X" amount of credits and earn credits with every win. ie. bet 100 credits to win 100 more credits. If credits reach 500 I win the game. If credits reach 0 I lose.
